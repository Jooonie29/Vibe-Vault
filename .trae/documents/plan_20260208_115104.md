I will fix the dropdown cropping issue and optimize the user search logic as follows:

### 1. Fix Dropdown Cropping (CSS/Layout)
*   **Problem:** The parent `Modal` component has `overflow-hidden`, which clips any absolute positioned children (like the dropdown) that extend beyond its bounds.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Modify `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx` to remove `overflow-hidden` from the main modal container.
    *   Apply `overflow-hidden` only to the inner content wrapper where scrolling is needed, or rely on `border-radius` clipping where appropriate, ensuring the dropdown can visually "break out" of the modal if necessary.

### 2. Optimize Search Logic (Backend)
*   **Problem:** The current search query performs a potentially inefficient index scan and doesn't utilize Convex's full-text search capabilities for "closest match" behavior.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Update Schema:** Modify `convex/schema.ts` to add a `searchIndex` on the `email` field of the `profiles` table. This enables efficient, relevance-based searching.
    *   **Update Query:** Refactor `convex/profiles.ts` to use `.withSearchIndex` instead of `.filter`. This will leverage the new search index to return results that closely match the typed query, rather than just strict prefix matches.

### 3. Verify Implementation
*   **Validation:** After changes, I will verify that the dropdown appears fully without being cut off and that typing in the search box returns relevant user results efficiently.
