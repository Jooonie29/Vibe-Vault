I have identified the issues and the files that need to be updated.

### 1. Fix "Share Board" Button Hover State in Dark Mode

The "Share Board" button uses the `outline` variant in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`.
Currently, the `outline` variant is defined as:
```tsx
outline: 'border-2 border-violet-600 text-violet-600 hover:bg-violet-50',
```
This lacks dark mode support. In dark mode, `hover:bg-violet-50` (which is a very light violet) might look bad or not be visible if the text color doesn't change or if the background is too bright for the dark theme. Also, the text color `text-violet-600` might need adjustment for dark mode (e.g., `dark:text-violet-400`), and the border too.

I will update the `outline` variant in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` to include dark mode styles:
```tsx
outline: 'border-2 border-violet-600 text-violet-600 hover:bg-violet-50 dark:border-violet-500 dark:text-violet-400 dark:hover:bg-violet-950/50',
```
(I'll verify the exact color values to match the theme).

### 2. Fix Popups (Toasts) in Dark Mode

There are two toast implementations:
a. **Sonner** (`src/components/ui/Toaster.tsx`): It uses `group-[.toaster]:bg-background group-[.toaster]:text-foreground`. If `bg-background` and `text-foreground` are correctly defined in the theme variables, this should be fine. However, the user says "pop ups in the dark mode as they can't be even seen". This usually happens when the background is white in dark mode or text is black in dark mode.
b. **Custom Toast** (`src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`): This implementation hardcodes colors:
```tsx
const colors = {
  success: 'bg-green-50 border-green-200 text-green-800',
  error: 'bg-red-50 border-red-200 text-red-800',
  warning: 'bg-amber-50 border-amber-200 text-amber-800',
  info: 'bg-blue-50 border-blue-200 text-blue-800',
};
```
These are definitely broken in dark mode (light backgrounds with dark text). I need to add dark mode classes to `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`.

I will update `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` to support dark mode:
```tsx
const colors = {
  success: 'bg-green-50 border-green-200 text-green-800 dark:bg-green-900/30 dark:border-green-800 dark:text-green-300',
  error: 'bg-red-50 border-red-200 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900/30 dark:border-red-800 dark:text-red-300',
  warning: 'bg-amber-50 border-amber-200 text-amber-800 dark:bg-amber-900/30 dark:border-amber-800 dark:text-amber-300',
  info: 'bg-blue-50 border-blue-200 text-blue-800 dark:bg-blue-900/30 dark:border-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300',
};
```
And also the close button hover state: `hover:bg-black/5 dark:hover:bg-white/10`.

I'll check `Toaster.tsx` as well to ensure `bg-background` and `text-foreground` are correct, but `Toast.tsx` is the most likely culprit for "can't be even seen" if it's being used. The screenshot showed a dark toast which looked okay (likely Sonner), but if the user complains, they might be seeing the Custom Toast or the Sonner one is missing borders/contrast. Given the screenshot "Showing data for..." which looks like a Sonner toast, maybe the user is referring to *other* notifications that use the custom toast. Or maybe the Sonner toast itself has issues in some contexts. I'll update both just to be safe, but focus on `Toast.tsx` as it clearly lacks dark mode.

I will start by creating a todo list.
