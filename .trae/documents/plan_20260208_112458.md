I will fix the issues in the `InviteModal` component as follows:

### 1. Fix the "White Screen" Crash
*   **Cause**: The crash occurs because some users might have an `undefined` email. When such a user is selected, `setEmail` sets the state to `undefined`, and the subsequent check `!email.trim()` throws a "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')" error.
*   **Solution**: In the click handler for the dropdown, I will ensure we fallback to an empty string if `user.email` is missing: `setEmail(user.email || '')`. Additionally, I will safeguard the `disabled` check on the button to handle non-string values gracefully.

### 2. Improve Dropdown Visibility (Cropped Emails)
*   **Cause**: The current CSS truncates content that overflows.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Update the dropdown container CSS to include `max-h-60 overflow-y-auto` to allow scrolling for long lists.
    *   Adjust the text display logic. The user requested "The email should be the one appearing in the modal when searching". I will swap the primary and secondary text:
        *   **Primary (Bold)**: Display the **Email** address.
        *   **Secondary (Muted)**: Display the **Name** (Full Name or Username).
    *   This ensures the email is always the most prominent information, matching the user's request and the input field's purpose.

### 3. Add "Invite Success" Feedback
*   **Cause**: The user mentioned "it didn't have a 'Invite success' modal appearing".
*   **Solution**:
    *   The current implementation uses `addToast` for success feedback. I will verify this is working correctly.
    *   To make it more explicit as requested, I will add a temporary success state within the modal itself (e.g., replacing the form with a success message/icon) or ensure the toast is prominent enough. Given the specific request for a "modal appearing", I'll modify the view state to show a "Success" view inside the modal after sending, before returning to the menu or closing.
