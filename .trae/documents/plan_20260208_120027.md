I have identified why "No email" is appearing.

**The Cause:**
The `UserSync` component forces the email to be an empty string (`''`) if `user.primaryEmailAddress` is missing at the exact moment the component mounts. This empty string is then saved to the database. When the search results display, they show "No email" because the value is technically present (as an empty string) but contains no text.

**The Solution:**
1.  **Wait for Email:** I will modify `UserSync.tsx` to **only** sync if `user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress` is actually present. This prevents overwriting valid data with empty strings during partial loads.
2.  **Fallback to All Emails:** Clerk provides a list of `emailAddresses`. I will check `user.emailAddresses[0]?.emailAddress` as a fallback if `primaryEmailAddress` is not yet set.
3.  **Correct Database Data:** Since some users (like "admin" and "joon") already have empty strings saved in the database, simply fixing the code won't fix *their* data until they log in again. I will recommend logging out and back in to trigger the corrected sync.

I will now update `UserSync.tsx` to be more robust.
