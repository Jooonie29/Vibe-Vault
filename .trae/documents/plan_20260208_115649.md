I have verified the code, and everything looks correct. However, if emails are still not appearing, it is likely due to one of these reasons:

1.  **Data Sync Lag:** The `UserSync` component only runs *after* a user logs in. If users registered *before* this component was added (or haven't logged in since), their `email` field in the database might be empty.
2.  **Indexing Delay:** Search indexes in databases (even fast ones like Convex) can sometimes take a moment to update after new data is added or a schema change is applied.
3.  **Search Query Strictness:** The `.search()` method is a full-text search. It might behave differently than a simple "starts with" prefix filter for partial matches (e.g., typing "joh" might not match "john@example.com" if the tokenizer splits strictly).

**Plan to Fix:**

1.  **Force Re-sync:** I will add a manual "Sync All" button or logic (temporarily) or just advise you to log out and log back in to force the `UserSync` to run for your account.
2.  **Robust Search Fallback:** To ensure results appear even if the full-text search is picky about partial inputs, I will add a **fallback** mechanism in the `searchUsers` query.
    *   **Primary:** Try the `search_email` index (good for relevance).
    *   **Secondary:** If that returns few/no results, perform a standard `filter` scan (using the `by_email` index) to catch simple prefix matches (e.g., `email >= query`). This guarantees that if "joon" exists, it will be found.

I will implement this **Robust Search Fallback** now to ensure you get results immediately.
